# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for bakers_timers

Summary
- This repository is currently empty. These instructions help an AI coding agent become productive: (1) discover the intended stack, (2) scaffold or repair missing project files, and (3) follow project-specific conventions when they appear.

Immediate steps for an AI agent
- Verify repo contents: list top-level files and branches (`ls -la`, `git branch --show-current`). If empty, prompt the human for the intended stack (Node, Python, Rust, Go, etc.).
- If asked to scaffold, create a minimal, runnable project and include a clear `README.md`, a `src/` folder, `tests/`, and a minimal dependency manifest (`package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml`).
- Before making breaking changes, open an issue or draft PR explaining the proposed scaffold.

What to look for when the code appears
- Entry points: look for `package.json` (`scripts.start`, `scripts.test`), `pyproject.toml` (console_scripts), `main.go`, `cmd/`, `server/`, or `app/` directories.
- Build and run commands: prefer `npm ci && npm test`, `pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest`, `cargo test`, or `go test ./...` depending on tooling found.
- Containerization: prefer `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to understand runtime environment and external services.

Project-specific guidance (when code exists)
- Configuration: prefer a single `config/` or `.env` file. If multiple env files exist, follow the `README.md` ordering (dev → staging → prod). If none exist, create a `.env.example` rather than committing secrets.
- Data / persistence: search for `migrations/`, `alembic/`, `db/` or `schemas/` to detect DB-backed components. Prefer lightweight local SQLite or in-memory alternatives for tests when a full DB isn't available.
- Background jobs: if you find `workers/`, `cron`, or `celery`/`bull` references, document dependencies and run instructions in `README.md`.

Coding patterns and conventions to preserve
- Keep public API/backwards-compatibility: if the repo exposes a library API (check `src/` packages or exported symbols), keep changes backwards compatible or provide deprecation notes.
- Tests-first changes: when adding features, add focused tests in `tests/` or alongside modules (e.g., `module_test.py`, `module.spec.ts`). Use existing test runner conventions.
- Small, focused commits: prefer one logical change per commit with descriptive messages.

Integration points and external dependencies
- If you find `Dockerfile`, `cloudbuild.yaml`, `.github/workflows/`, or `terraform/`, assume CI/CD and cloud infra are important; do not change deployment-critical files without approval.
- If external services are referenced (AWS, Redis, PostgreSQL, external APIs), add mocks or service stubs for local development and tests.

Examples (templates the agent should use)
- Node.js `package.json` script example:

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "test": "jest --runInBand"
  }

- Python minimal `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` with `pytest` for tests.

When the repository is empty (this repo)
- Ask the user which stack they want. Offer scaffolds for common stacks (Node API, Python CLI, Rust binary) with small runnable examples and tests.
- Suggested first PR contents for scaffolding:
  - `README.md` with run/test instructions
  - A minimal `src/` with one entrypoint and one passing test
  - Dependency manifest (`package.json` / `pyproject.toml`) and `.gitignore`

Safety and review
- Never commit secrets. If a secret is found, redact it and open an issue noting the leak.
- For large changes or scaffolds, open a draft PR and summarize the reason, files added, and how to run locally.

If you (human) are available
- Tell the agent which language/runtime you want for `bakers_timers` and whether to scaffold a CLI, web API, or mobile-friendly timer.

Contact / follow-up
- After scaffolding or adding major files, run the project's basic checks (install deps, run tests) and report results in the PR description.

End of instructions.
